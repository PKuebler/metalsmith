# Install it

Metalsmith and its plugins can be installed with npm:

```bash
$ npm install metalsmith
```

The package exposes both a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#api), and [CLI](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#cli) in case you're used to that type of workflow from other static site generators. To see how they're used check out the [examples](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/tree/master/examples).
